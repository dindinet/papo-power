## Website Fundamentals
### Getting It Wrong Has a Negative Effect on Your Marketing

When you invest time and budget into understanding the needs of your audience and go on to craft exceptional content which will bring them closer to saying yes the last thing you want is for your website to sabotage your efforts. Sounds insane doesn't it/ Who would indulge in such self harm? In my experience this scenario is all too common. 

 You want to be sure your content gets seen by as many of the right people as possible. Anything that prevents your message from being consumed needs to be iradicated. Your target audience are human beings that need or want your offer. For your message to reach it's target it must be designed to appeal directly to the reader. To design such a message you need to invest time to understand the needs and motivations of the reader.
